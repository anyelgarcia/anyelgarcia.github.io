I am a Computer Science and Mathematics graduate and currently I am finishing my Phd in Mathematics in [Universidad de Murcia](https://um.es) as a [FPU](https://www.educacionyfp.gob.es/servicios-al-ciudadano/catalogo/general/99/998758/ficha/998758-informacion-comun.html) fellow.

The main purpose of my research has been to solve a partial form of the isomorphism problem for group rings, specifically for metacyclic groups. This is, I am trying to find ways to identify a group from its group ring. So, my main areas of interest are group theory and representation theory. I am also interested in computational group theory and criptography on the side.
